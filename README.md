Objective: The primary aim of this project is to create a backend server that interacts with OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model API and enables a conversational interface with the GPT model. Depending upon your proficiency and comfort, you may choose to work with Node.js or Java.

### **Task:**

1. **Understanding the ChatGPT model:** Learn about OpenAI's GPT model, how it works, and its applications. Understand the API documentation provided by OpenAI.
2. **API Key:** Register on the OpenAI website and retrieve your API key.
    1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/
    2. Select View API Keys

1. **Backend Setup:** Set up your backend environment. You can choose Node.js or Java based on your preference. If you are using Node.js, you may use Express.js for setting up your server. If you're using Java, you can use Spring Boot.
2. **Connecting with OpenAI API:** Connect your backend server with the OpenAI GPT API. Use the API key you received to authenticate your requests.
3. **Conversational Interface:** Develop an interface to send user queries to the GPT model and display the generated response. You can start with a command-line interface (CLI) that takes user input, sends it to the API, and shows the API response.
4. **Input and Output:** Design your application to ask the user for input, send this input as a prompt to the GPT model, and receive a response. Display this response to the user.

## **Objective**

The main objective of this project is to design and develop a highly interactive, visually appealing web application that uses the capabilities of ChatGPT for generating different types of content. The content could range from Shayaris, Jokes, to Short Stories, etc.

## Assignment **Ideas (choose anyone from this)**

**Assignment 1: Shayari Generator**

- Task: Create a basic web app that utilizes ChatGPT to generate Shayaris based on a given keyword.
- Skills involved: Basic frontend, backend, and ChatGPT integration.

**Assignment 2: Joke Generator**

- Task: Develop an application that can create jokes using ChatGPT. The app should allow the user to specify the type of joke (e.g., knock-knock, light bulb, etc.).
- Skills involved: User input handling, frontend, backend, and ChatGPT integration.

**Assignment 3: Story Generator**

- Task: Construct a web app that creates short stories with ChatGPT The user should be able to define the genre of the story, and the story should be appropriately formatted.
- Skills involved: Advanced user input handling, frontend, backend, ChatGPT integration, and data formatting.

**Assignment 4: Quote Generator**

- Task: Develop an application that generates inspirational or motivational quotes using ChatGPT. The user should be able to choose the quote's theme (love, life, success, etc.).
- Skills involved: User input handling, frontend, backend, and ChatGPT integration.

## **Skills Required**

- Knowledge of Frontend (React.js, HTML/CSS) with a strong emphasis on UI/UX design.
- Understanding of Backend (Node.js or Java)
- Basic understanding of APIs, REST, and CRUD operations.
- Familiarity with ChatGPT and how to use it in applications.

## Assignment **Description**

The application should be capable of generating different types of content based on user preference. The UI should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, with high-level styling and animation. The backend can be built with Node.js or Java, depending on your expertise and preference.

The central feature of the application should be the integration of ChatGPT. Users should be able to interact with the AI model and ask it to generate different types of content like Shayaris, Jokes, Stories, etc. There should also be the ability to control the AI output's length, genre, or theme (if applicable) as part of the user's request.

## **Detailed Requirements**

### **1. Frontend**

- Use basic frontend using HTML/CSS and javscript for creating the UI.
- The UI should include options for users to choose the type of content they want to generate (like Shayaris, Jokes, Stories, etc.)
- Include customization options such as length, theme, genre, etc. if applicable.
- The app should be visually appealing and have smooth navigation. Use advanced CSS techniques for styling and animation to create a rich user experience.

### **2. Backend**

- You can use Node.js or Java for creating the server-side logic.
- It should manage user requests, process them, and interact with ChatGPT to generate the required content.
- Implement proper RESTful API architecture.

### **3.** ChatGPT **Integration**

- Integrate ChatGPT into the application for generating the content.
- It should be able to handle different types of content and any customizations included by the user.

### **4. Extras**

- Implement user authentication and allow users to save their favorite generated content.
- Allow sharing of the generated content on social media platforms.

## **Assessment**

Projects will be assessed based on their UI/UX design, functionality, integration of ChatGPT, and how well the backend handles requests and delivers responses. Bonus points for adding extra features and creative use of ChatGPT.
